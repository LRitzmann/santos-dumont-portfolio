                  <p class="bio-text">Alberto Santos-Dumont was a Brazilian aeronaut, sportsman, inventor, and one of the few people to have contributed significantly to the early development of both lighter-than-air and heavier-than-air aircraft. The heir of a wealthy family of coffee producers, he dedicated himself to aeronautical study and experimentation in Paris, where he spent most of his adult life. He designed, built, and flew the first powered airships and won the Deutsch Prize in 1901, when he flew around the Eiffel Tower in his airship No. 6, becoming one of the most famous people in the world in the early 20th century.</p>

According to biographer Gondin da Fonseca, Santos Dumont was influenced to create his first balloon after following the Paris-Amsterdam race on his tricycle.</p>

Snowy conditions caused the airship to flex and crash. "At a height of five or six metres, over Longchamp, the apparatus suddenly bent and the crash began.

Other innovations included the use of piano wire to suspend the gondola, reducing drag, and the use of water ballast tanks.
