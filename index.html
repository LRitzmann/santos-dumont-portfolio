                <p class="bio-text">Alberto Santos-Dumont was a Brazilian aeronaut, sportsman, inventor, and one of the few people to have contributed significantly to the early development of both lighter-than-air and heavier-than-air aircraft. The heir of a wealthy family of coffee producers, he dedicated himself to aeronautical study and experimentation in Paris, where he spent most of his adult life. He designed, built, and flew the first powered airships and won the Deutsch Prize in 1901, when he flew around the Eiffel Tower in his airship No. 6, becoming one of the most famous people in the world in the early 20th century.</p>

              <p class="work-text">Brazil first flew on 4 July 1898, and was the smallest aircraft built at the time â€“ inflated with hydrogen, it covered 113 metres in a silk envelope of 6 metres in diameter, weighing 27.5 kg without the crewman and made more than 200 flights. According to biographer Gondin da Fonseca, Santos Dumont was influenced to create his first balloon after following the Paris-Amsterdam race on his tricycle.</p>

              <p class="work-text">The first airship designed by Santos-Dumont, the No. 1, was 25 metres long with a volume of 186 cubic metres, made its first takeoff attempt in February 1898, after being inflated in Henri Lachambre's workshops in Vaugirard. Snowy conditions caused the airship to flex and crash. "At a height of five or six metres, over Longchamp, the apparatus suddenly bent and the crash began. Of my entire career, this is the most abominable memory I have in store."</p>

              <p class="work-text">No. 5 was built to compete for the Henry Deutsch de la Meurthe award for a flight from the Aero-Club de France airfield in Saint-Cloud to the Eiffel Tower and back in 30 minutes. It used the extended envelope of No. 4, from which a triangular gondola made of pine was suspended. Other innovations included the use of piano wire to suspend the gondola, reducing drag, and the use of water ballast tanks. It was powered by a 12 hp, 4-cylinder air-cooled engine driving a propeller.</p>

              <p class="work-text">No. 9, with 261 cubic metres and 3 hp, was a travel airship, in which Santos-Dumont made several flights throughout 1903, including the first night flight of an airship on 24 June, and the last of these came on 14 July, when it took part in a military parade in commemoration of the 114th anniversary of the Storming of the Bastille. The first woman to fly an aircraft was Aida de Acosta, on 29 June 1903, in No. 9.</p>

For completing the 14-bis, on 18 July Santos-Dumont signed up to compete in the events and presented the exotic aircraft for the first time the next day, attached to a balloon, at Bagatelle, where he ran some races, obtaining appreciable jumps.</p>
